The following tasks are handled in the directory:    

- [x] **0-rectangle.py**   
Creates an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:   
	* No module is imported   

- [x] **1-rectangle.py**   
Class Rectangle has been given setter and getter methods for both height and width.    
* If height is not an integer:   
	`raise TypeError`   
* If height is less than 0:   
	`raise ValueError`  
* An `__init__` method instantiates widhth and height to zero.    

- [x] **2-rectangle.py**   
Area and Perimeter methods have been added to the class rectangle.   
* if width or height is zero, the perimeter becomes zero     

- [x] **3-rectangle.py**    
`__str__(self)` is implemented which prints the rectangle interms of `#`.   
* if the either width or height is zero, empty string is returned    

- [x] **4-rectangle.py**    
`__repr__(self:)` function implemented   

- [x] **5-rectangle.py**   
`__del__(self)` implemented.   

- [x] ** 6-rectangle.py**    
Implementing `number_of_instances` of the rectangle created    
* A public class variable is used  

- [ ] ** 7-rectangle.py**    
Implementing a public class attribute `print_symbol`   
* The symbol is initialized to `#`
