### 0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping   
=========================================     
The aim of the project is to aid in linking databases and the python. The first section comprises of the using the module `MySQLdb` to connect to MySQL database and executing the SQL queries.  The second part involves using the module `SQLAlchemy` which is an object Relational Mapper (ORM). ORM is aimed to abstract the storage to the usage. No SQl queiries are involved, except writing Python code. It also ensures the code is not storage type dependent. This will allow the changing the storage entirely without re-writing the entire project.     
Both `MySqLdb` and `SQLAlchemy` are installed for the projects.
